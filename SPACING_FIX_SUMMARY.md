# ✅ Header Spacing Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

The spacing between the "Log Out" link and your avatar image is now **consistent across all pages**, matching the home.html layout exactly.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

You noticed that different pages had different spacing between "Log Out" and the avatar:
- Home page had correct spacing (24px)
- Other pages had wider spacing (32px) 
- Password page was missing the avatar entirely!

## ✅ The Solution

All pages now have:
- **24px spacing** between "Log Out" and avatar (matches home.html)
- **Avatar present** on every page
- **Consistent layout** across the entire application

---
