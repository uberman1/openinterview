# OpenInterview Patch — Enhanced Editor Routing & Page

This patch adds the enhanced profile editor page, fixes routing so **Edit → Template (dummy) → Enhanced Editor**, and keeps old links safe via redirect.

## Contents
- `public/profile_edit_enhanced.html` — new enhanced editor page (uses your exact UI)
- `public/js/profile_edit.bind.js` — binder wiring (resume GPT populate + availability)
- `patches/*.diff` — small diffs for routing and server
- `docs/DEPLOY_STEPS.md` — how to deploy on Replit
- `outputs/verify.json` — quick verification report

## Backend requirement
Provide `POST /api/ai/extract_profile` (multipart: `file`, `profileId`) that returns:
```json
{ "name":"", "title":"", "contact":{"email":"","phone":"","location":""},
  "socials":{"linkedin":"","portfolio":"","github":"","twitter":"","website":""},
  "bio":"", "highlights":["...","..."] }
```
