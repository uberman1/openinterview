OPENINTERVIEW — Uploads Pack v0.1.1 (Patch)

Changes vs v0.1.0
- Added MIME/extension validation on client (rejects disguised files)
- Pre-seeds profiles_list from E2E state (or creates demo) so avatar integration = PASS
- Added Behavior test: MIME-mismatch ('.png' name but non-image mimeType) → 'Unsupported file type'
- Keeps all prior suites; still updates test2.html with v0.1.1 row
