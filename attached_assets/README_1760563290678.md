# ES Module Guardrails — Self-Deploy (Replit)

## What this does
- Removes any loose IIFE `guardrails-loose.js` script tags from your HTML.
- Copies **js/home-guardrails-module.js** (single-source ES module).
- Wires it into your existing **/js/home-uat.js** by appending an import + init call (once).

## Why this works
- Prevents double-runtime and re-initialization.
- No DOM cloning; binds once with `data-bound` to avoid duplicates.
- Avatar uses direct element references and persists to localStorage.
- Attachments section deduped once at boot; bottom-only links normalized for Resumes & Attachments.

## How to use
```bash
npm install
npm run apply
# optional tests
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm run test:e2e
```
