OPENINTERVIEW — PASSWORD RESET QA (Option A)

What this includes
- public/password_reset.html — a new reset page matching the QA contract
- password_pack/ — contract-driven test bundle (v0.1.4), already pointing to /password_reset.html

How to run on Replit
1) Install dependencies & browser:
   pip install -r password_pack/requirements.txt
   python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium

2) If your preview URL is not http://127.0.0.1:8000, export it:
   export OI_BASE_URL="https://<your-replit-preview-domain>"

3) Execute the full test suite:
   python password_pack/run.py

Outputs
- qa/password/v0.1.4/* (JSON/TXT artifacts, visual baselines/diffs, page snapshot)
- test2.html — automatically appends a new row under the Password section with links to the page, source, and tests.

Notes
- This does NOT modify protected public/password.html.
- You can restyle password_reset.html freely later; keep the element IDs/attributes to preserve tests.
