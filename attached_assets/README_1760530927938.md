# Loose Guardrails Deployment (Replit)

## What this does
- Injects `js/guardrails-loose.js` into your page without changing UI.
- On load:
  - Deduplicates extra **Attachments** sections.
  - Ensures **bottom-only** upload links and binds them.
  - Replaces legacy avatar listeners; previews with FileReader + persists.

## How to use
1) Upload & extract this zip to your project root.
2) Run:
```bash
npm install
npm run apply
```
3) (Optional) Run tests:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
The tests will start a tiny server and verify:
- Single Attachments section
- One bottom link in Resumes and Attachments
- Avatar updates and persists
