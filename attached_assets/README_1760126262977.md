# OpenInterview.me — `test2.html` Self‑Deploy Package

This package adds a **Test & Validation page** (`test2.html`) designed to track versions and test artifacts across key UI areas (Home, Shareable Profile, Availability, Profiles, Uploads, Subscription, Password).

## Files
- `test2.html` — the QA page (no dependencies, white background, black text, minimal CSS).
- `GUARDRAILS.md` — rules & safe admin entry approach.
- `README.md` — this file.

## Deploy (Replit)
1. Create or open your Replit project.
2. Upload these files to the project root.
3. Serve statically (examples):
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8080`
   - Node (if you already run one): ensure it serves static files from `.`
4. Visit `/test2.html` to use the page.

## Using the Page
- Each section has a table: **version / description / link / code / Test file**.
- Add rows manually in the HTML for auditability, or link out to external artifacts (GitHub raw, Gists, Drive, etc.).
- Keep it read‑only: it’s meant to *index* the latest versions and test logs, not to mutate production data.

## Optional: Admin Entry Without Editing Protected Files
If you want a button on `/#/admin` that opens `/test2.html`, copy the snippet from `GUARDRAILS.md` and paste it into the browser console while viewing `/#/admin`. This maintains your guardrails (no persistent code changes).

## Notes
- The page includes `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`.
- Stay under Replit’s 20‑file limit — this package is just 3 files.
