# Stage 3 — Staging Pilot & Production Hardening (v0.3.0)

This bundle lets Replit (or CI) run a staging pilot against your live API-mode backend
and record artifacts + status back into `public/test2.html`.

## What it does
- Spins up a staging smoke (requests-based) against your FastAPI backend.
- Runs the Release Gate in API mode (HOME_API=1).
- Saves results under `qa/stage3/v0.3.0/`.
- Adds a Stage 3 row to `public/test2.html` (“Staging Pilot – v0.3.0”).

## Quick start

1) Start backend (in another terminal):
```bash
bash scripts/serve_api.sh
```

2) Set environment and run Stage 3 orchestrator:
```bash
export HOME_API=1
export HEALTH_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/health"
export OI_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
PYTHONPATH=. python stage3/run_stage3.py
```

Artifacts land in `qa/stage3/v0.3.0/` and the index page is updated.
