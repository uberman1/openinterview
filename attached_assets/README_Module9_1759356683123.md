# Module 09 — Interview Workflow (Scheduling + Statuses)

Goal
- Add scheduling fields and status transitions to Interviews.
- Add update and reminder endpoints.
- Add list filters by status and date range.
- Extend selftest with workflow checks.

Included
- server/routes.interviews.reference.ts  (extended with PATCH + remind + filters)
- server/routes.interviews.ts.patch      (patch hints for your existing routes)
- scripts/selftest.js                    (unified runner extended with Module 09 checks)
- README_Module9.md
- guardrails_m09.txt

How to apply
1) Update your interviews routes per `server/routes.interviews.ts.patch`.
   If your file differs a lot, use `server/routes.interviews.reference.ts` as a template and adapt to your project.

2) Replace `/scripts/selftest.js` with the one in this archive.

3) Run:
   npm run build
   MODULE_NUM=09 node scripts/selftest.js

Success
- interviews.create → 201 with scheduledAt and status 'scheduled' accepted
- interviews.update → 200 updates status and/or scheduledAt
- interviews.remind → 204 and log entry written
- interviews.list with status/date filters returns expected items
- invalid transition returns 400
- Selftest prints ALL CHECKS PASSED; writes logs/selftest.mod-09.json and logs/mod-09.log
