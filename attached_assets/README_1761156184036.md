# PR: Email Share Flow — CDN-Free Drop-In

This PR removes CDN dependencies, switches to an inline Lucide icon, unifies toast helpers, and includes a Playwright test. It **does not touch** your public profile viewer.

## Files

- `share.html` — popup-like standalone page (no CDNs; Lucide SVG; origin-scoped postMessage)
- `js/utils.js` — unified `toast()` + minimal styles
- `js/email_template.js` — subject + HTML builder (inline CSS; no CDNs)
- `js/mailer.mock.js` — local outbox + preview window
- `outbox.html` — dev viewer for sent emails
- `tests/share-flow.spec.ts` — e2e test
- `playwright.config.js`, `package.json`
- `css/README.txt` — placeholder if you need to drop in compiled Tailwind

> Assumes your app serves **/css/tailwind.css**. If not, place your compiled Tailwind there.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm run serve
npm run test:e2e
```

## Production hook

Replace `sendEmail()` in `js/mailer.mock.js` with your API call (SendGrid/Mailgun/SES). Keep the same function signature.
