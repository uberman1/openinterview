# GUARDRAILS

- This project **does not** modify your UI files.
- Guardrails **seal** the current checksums of key UI files on the first test run into `guardrails.json`.
- On subsequent runs, if any protected file changes, the test fails with a checksum mismatch.
- To intentionally accept UI changes, delete `guardrails.json` and run `node selftest.mjs` again to re-seal.

**Protected (default):**
- `public/login.html`
- `public/css/theme.css`
- `public/index.html`

You can edit the `PROTECTED` array inside `selftest.mjs` to add more files if needed.
