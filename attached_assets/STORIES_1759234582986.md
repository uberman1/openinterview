# Module 0 Stories

## User Stories
1. As a developer, I can run `npm run dev` and see API+Web running locally with zero external deps.
2. As a reviewer, I can hit `/api/v1/health` and see which adapters are active.
3. As a developer, I can run `npm test` and receive a single pass/fail report in `/logs/selftest.json`.
4. As a PM, I can read `README.md` to understand how future modules swap mocks for real adapters safely.

## Technical Stories
1. As a system, I provide a typed adapter registry that returns mocks by default and isolates external deps.
2. As a system, I apply standard security middleware (helmet, cors with allowlist, rate-limit, body caps).
3. As a system, I provide contract tests for health and adapter shape, to prevent regressions when swapping impls.
