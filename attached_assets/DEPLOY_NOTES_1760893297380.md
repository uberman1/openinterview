# Deploy Notes — Enhanced Editor Patch
Date: 2025-10-19

This package includes a complete **profile_edit_enhanced.html** and an updated **profile_edit.bind.js**.

## What changed
- Replaced button-based resume import with **Select + Drag & Drop** UI.
- Kept hidden legacy buttons (with `data-testid`) to preserve tests/binder compatibility.
- Inserted **video placeholder** under resume section.
- Added **Phone** and **Email** inline fields under Title.
- Renamed "Short Bio" to **Profile Summary** and updated placeholder.
- Synced Availability UI with `availability.html` (Weekly Hours, Quick Actions, Rules).
- Binder now supports:
  - GPT extraction via `/api/ai/extract_profile`
  - Drag & drop resume upload
  - Dynamic resume dropdown sourced from current profile (resume + resume-like attachments)
  - Availability save/revert/quick-actions

## How to deploy
1. Copy `public/profile_edit_enhanced.html` and `public/js/profile_edit.bind.js` into your app.
2. Ensure your server serves `/profile_edit_enhanced.html` and that the "Edit" buttons route to it.
3. Backend endpoint required: `POST /api/ai/extract_profile` returning JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "name":"…","title":"…",
     "contact":{"email":"…","phone":"…","location":"…"},
     "socials":{"linkedin":"…","portfolio":"…","github":"…","twitter":"…","website":"…"},
     "bio":"…","highlights":["…","…"]
   }
   ```
4. Test the flow: create profile → view → **Edit Profile** → use resume import.
