# OpenInterview — profile_edit_enhanced.html Patch

This patch updates the Edit Profile page with **direct HTML edits** and **minimal inline logic**, per the project direction to avoid heavy scripting.

## What changed
1. **Header buttons**
   - Removed the secondary “Save Profile” button.
   - Kept “Save & Return”; it now validates *Profile Name* before saving.

2. **Profile Name (required)**
   - The input is now required (with `required` + inline error message).
   - If empty, save is blocked and the error text appears.

3. **Auto‑populate helper text**
   - Updated the sentence to: “Select an existing resume or upload a new one to automatically fill out your profile (PDF files only).”
   - Resume upload UI now filters files with `accept="application/pdf,.pdf"`.

4. **Availability section cleanup & help text**
   - Removed local “Revert” and “Save” buttons in **Set Your Availability**.
   - Added/moved help text under **Increments**, **Buffers**, and **Daily Cap**, including the multi‑line increments explainer.

5. **No new heavy JS**
   - The only logic added is a tiny inline validation on “Save & Return” to enforce *Profile Name*.
   - All existing page binders remain unchanged.

## Install
- If your project keeps the edit page in `/profile_v4_1_package/public/`, run:
  ```bash
  bash install.sh
  ```
  This will place the updated file in the expected path if it exists, falling back to the repo root otherwise.

## Notes
- The dropdown population and GPT auto‑populate require existing project modules/services and are **not** included here (no extra scripting added). The UI & copy are ready.
