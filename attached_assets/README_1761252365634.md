# Dual Editor Bundle: Standalone Formatting Page + Integrated Dev Page

This bundle gives you:
1) **Standalone formatting page** (`/mock/profile_editor_mock.html`) — zero JS, no CDNs. For typography/spacing checks.
2) **Integrated dev page** (`/dev/profile_edit_dev.html`) — same DOM hooks as your real editor, includes a safe-render shim, and a toggle to redirect to prod later.

## Run
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm run serve
npm run test:e2e

## Promote to Prod Later
- Replace inline behaviors in `dev/profile_edit_dev.html` with your real editor JS, OR
- Append `?mode=prod` (update the `prodUrl` inside that file) to hand off to your production editor route.
