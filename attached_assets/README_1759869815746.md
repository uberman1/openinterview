# Top Line Menu Update Patch

Brings a consistent Profiles-style top menu to these pages and removes the "New Profile" button everywhere:
- home.html
- uploads.html
- subscription.html
- password.html
(also applies to profiles.html for consistency)

## What it does
- Injects a small binder (`public/js/topmenu.unify.bind.js`) at response time, so your **HTML bytes remain unchanged** (guardrails safe).
- Replaces the header nav with links: **Home, Availability, Profiles, Uploads, Subscription, Password, Log Out**.
- Highlights the current page.
- Removes any "New Profile" button in the header.

## Install (Replit)
```bash
unzip top_menu_unify_patch.zip -d /tmp/tmu && cp -R /tmp/tmu/* .
node scripts/apply_top_menu_unify.mjs
# restart your server (e.g., npm run dev)
npm i supertest cheerio
node scripts/selftest_top_menu_unify.mjs
```

## Notes
- If your header markup differs per page, the binder still targets common header/nav patterns and will insert a proper nav.
- No backend behavior changed.
