# Temporary Safe Render Patch (Anti-Blank Watchdog)
Copy `js/safe-render-shim.js` to your project, then include this tag on affected pages (before other scripts, after Tailwind):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/tailwind.css" />
<script src="/js/safe-render-shim.js"></script>
```
Optional for tests: append `?safe=1` to force safe mode.
Remove both when permanent fix is deployed.
