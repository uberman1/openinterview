# PATCH: Availability — Add "Home" Button (Replit Guardrailed)

This patch adds a **Home** button (same look as **Save**) to the `availability.html`
page header, positioned **next to Save** and linking to `/home.html`.

## What this does
- Inserts `<a id="btnHome" href="/home.html" class="px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-primary text-white">Home</a>`
  immediately after the **Save** button inside the header button group.
- Makes **no other changes**. A backup of `public/availability.html` is created.

## Guardrails
- The patch script only writes **public/availability.html**.
- A **self-test** reports whether the change exists and that Revert/Save remain intact.
- No `.replit` or `package.json` changes are attempted.
- All scripts are **read-only** regarding other files.

## How to apply (from your project root in Replit)
```bash
# 1) Unzip the patch contents into your project root (do not overwrite your files except these scripts)
# 2) Run the patch:
node scripts/apply_availability_home_button.mjs

# 3) Run the self-test (reports only):
node tests/selftest.mjs
```

## Reverting
Each run creates a timestamped backup:
`public/availability.html.bak.<timestamp>`

To revert manually, copy the latest backup over `public/availability.html`.

## Expected outcome
- You will see a **Home** button to the right of **Save** on `/availability.html`.
- Clicking **Home** navigates to `/home.html`.
