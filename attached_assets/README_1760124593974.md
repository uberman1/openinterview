# OpenInterview.me — Minimal QA Index (<=20 files)

This bundle is intentionally tiny for Replit’s file limits.

## Files
- `test.html` — self-contained QA index page (sections, tables, Add Row controls). Uses `localStorage` to persist rows you add.
- *(Optional)* `README.md` — this file.

## How to use
1. Create a new Replit and upload these files (or paste `test.html` directly).
2. Run any simple static server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8080`).
3. Open `/test.html`.
4. Click “Add Row” in any section to append a new version. Paste external links or `data:` URLs for **code** and **test** columns to avoid storing many files.

## Tips
- You can still link to real files hosted elsewhere (GitHub raw, Gist, Cloud storage) to keep this Replit minimal.
- If you later need on-Replit artifacts, keep total files under the limit by pruning old ones or consolidating into a single `artifacts.txt` and deep-linking via anchors.
