# OpenInterview Shareable Profile Scroll Patch (Replit Ready)

## Summary
This patch updates the **Shareable Profile page** layout so:
- The section beneath the video (Attachments, Highlights, Resume) scrolls independently.
- The right sidebar (Schedule + Profile Summary) stays fixed in place.
- Text below the video never scrolls behind the video — the scrollable pane is fully separated.

## Files
- `client/public/shareable.html` – updated layout for the shareable profile page.
- `guardrails/*` – safety scripts to prevent modifying any files outside this patch.
- `tests/frontend/shareable-scroll.spec.mjs` – jsdom test verifying scroll area + structure.
- `tests/selftest.mod-oi-shareable-scroll.json` – self-test manifest for Replit verification.

## Apply
```bash
node guardrails/verify-guardrails.cjs
node guardrails/apply_patch.mjs
```

## Test
```bash
npm i
npm test
```
