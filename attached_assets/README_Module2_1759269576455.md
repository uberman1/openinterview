# Module 2 — Client Foundation (No new deps)

**Purpose:** Add a minimal client-side router, pages, forms, and an API wrapper to exercise
Module 1 endpoints end-to-end — without adding new libraries.

## What’s included
- Tiny **hash router** (no dependencies) and navigation helpers.
- Global **Error Boundary** and a **NotFound** fallback.
- Pages:
  - Dashboard (`/#/`)
  - Profiles List (`/#/profiles`)
  - New Profile (`/#/profiles/new`)
  - Profile Detail (`/#/profiles/:id`)
  - New Interview (`/#/profiles/:id/interviews/new`)
- API wrapper (`/client/src/api.js`) with JSON + error normalization.

## Exit Criteria
- Create a profile from the UI -> it appears in Profiles list.
- Open Profile detail -> create interview -> it appears in the list.
- Friendly error messages (no raw stack traces) for API errors.
- `npm test` still passes (build succeeds).

## Apply
Copy these files into `/client/src/`, replacing `main.jsx` with the patch version.
