# OpenInterview.me — Shareable Patch
This ZIP updates **profile_edit_enhanced.html** to use the correct **Auto‑populate with Resume** UI:
- A **Select a resume** drop‑down (pull from existing uploads)
- A **Drag & drop / Browse** uploader (adds new resumes to the user's library)
- Video placeholder is directly beneath the resume section

## Files included
- `public/profile_edit_enhanced.html` — updated markup

## Integration notes
- The binder (`/js/profile_edit.bind.js`) in your repo should already handle resume selection + uploads.
- If you use a feature-flagged rollout, ensure edit routes point to `/profile_edit_enhanced.html?id={profileId}`.
