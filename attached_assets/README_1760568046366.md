# Nav Cleanup + Redirect Shim (Replit-ready)

This drop-in package:
- Rewrites the top menu to **Home, Subscription, Password, Log Out** on every page.
- Adds a **client-side redirect** from legacy routes to Home anchors:
  - `/profile`, `/profiles`, `/account` → `home.html#profile`
  - `/uploads`, `/documents` → `home.html#attachments`
- Includes Playwright tests and a tiny server for local verification.

## Use
1. Upload this folder into your Replit project root.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run apply
   ```
   This backs up and patches all `*.html` files to inject the scripts.
3. (Optional) run tests:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

## Files
- `js/nav-patch.js` — Replaces top nav DOM with the four canonical items (no UI style changes).
- `js/redirect-shim.js` — Redirects legacy routes to anchors on Home.
- `apply-nav-cleanup.mjs` — Injects both scripts into all `*.html` files in the project.
- `serve.mjs` — Static test server for Playwright.
- `tests/specs/nav-cleanup.spec.ts` — Minimal e2e tests.
