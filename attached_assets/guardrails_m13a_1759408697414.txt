Scope: Implement a working Login UI only. Do not change package.json, install packages, or edit server configs/env. Keep TS/Vite architecture and existing auth endpoints.

Allowed actions:
- Replace /client/src/pages/Login.jsx with provided form implementation
- Add /client/src/lib/api.js and /client/src/lib/auth.js
- Update client router to ensure a /login route exists (no other route changes)
- Optionally add scripts/selftest.m13a.js (API smoke); primary validation is manual UI

Run:
  npm run build
  npm run dev   (then open /login)

Success:
- /login shows email + password inputs and a Login button
- Submitting calls /api/v1/auth/login and handles errors
- On success, token is saved and user is redirected:
  - admin@example.com → /admin
  - others → /dashboard
