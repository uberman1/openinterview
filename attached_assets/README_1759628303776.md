# Module 2 (User) — Replit-ready

## What it ships
- Home/Dashboard, Availability, Profiles list, Profile Editor, Uploads (library + per-profile assignment), Subscription, Password.
- Profiles are packages: each profile owns exactly one resume, its own links, and its own uploads.
- Any profile can be shared via `/u/:handle` — default is optional and only used as a shortcut.
- Guardrails: checksums for all HTML screens + theme.css.
- Self-tests: default flip, per-profile resume, attachments assign/unassign, public package assembly, availability save/load.

## Run
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
