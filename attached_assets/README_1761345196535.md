# OpenInterview — Home Page Row Limiter Patch

This patch updates **home.html** so that each table section shows **a maximum of 5 rows** by default, with a **left-aligned “Show all”** text link placed **beneath the table** to expand/collapse the full list.

## What’s included
- `home.html` — adds a new script include for the limiter.
- `js/home-list-limit.js` — generic logic that:
  - Hides table rows beyond 5 for each section.
  - Injects a left-aligned “Show all” link under the table card.
  - Toggles to “Show less” and collapses back to 5 rows.
  - Targets sections by `tbody` IDs: `upcoming-body`, `interviews-body`, `resumes-body`, `attachments-body`.

## How it works
The script finds the `.overflow-hidden.rounded.border` table container for each section and inserts a small text link **directly after** it, which places the link visually **beneath the table on the left** (per your mock). If a section has 5 or fewer rows, no link is added.

## Deploy (Replit)
1. Upload the folder contents to your Replit project, preserving structure:
   ```
   /home.html
   /js/home-list-limit.js
   ```
2. Ensure your app serves `home.html` at the expected route (unchanged).
3. No build steps are required. Refresh the page to see the limiter + link.

## Extending
To add another section, give its table body a unique ID and add it to the array in `home-list-limit.js`:
```js
["upcoming-body", "interviews-body", "resumes-body", "attachments-body", "new-section-body"]
  .forEach(id => setupLimiter(id));
```
