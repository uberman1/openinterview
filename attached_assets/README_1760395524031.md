# OpenInterview – `home.html` UAT Patch (Replit-Ready)

This package adds **functional uploads and action links** to `home.html` with **no layout changes**:

- Resumes → **Add New** (multi-file) ⇒ rows appear & persist
- Attachments (new section) → **Create New** (multi-file) ⇒ rows appear & persist
- Avatar click (profile image) ⇒ choose image ⇒ updates **both avatars** & persists
- All **Edit/Delete** links work (Interviews/Resumes/Attachments) and persist
- Upcoming Interviews → **View Details** sets a view context and hash-navigates

---

## Files

- `home.html` – drop-in page with minimal script and IDs
- `tests/home.actions.spec.js` – Edit/Delete/View behaviors
- `tests/home.attachments-avatar.spec.js` – Upload flows + avatar
- `package.json` – Jest + jsdom config

---

## How to use in Replit

1. **Upload** this ZIP and extract into your project root (or replace existing `home.html`).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   ```
3. Open `home.html` in your preview/server and UAT the flows.

> The script uses **localStorage** to persist within the browser tab (no backend).

## Notes

- No changes to the **Create New Interview** workflow were made.
- All styles are preserved; only IDs, hidden inputs, and a small script were added.
- You can later replace storage stubs with API calls behind feature flags.
