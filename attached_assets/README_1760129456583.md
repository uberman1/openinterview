# Password Page QA — Self-Deploy Package

## Steps
1. Upload and unzip into your Replit project root.
2. Ensure `test2.html` exists at project root (from earlier package). If missing, add it.
3. Replace `src/password.html` with your real page content.
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 run_tests.py
   ```
5. Open artifacts:
   - `qa/password/v0.1.1/tests.txt`
   - `qa/password/v0.1.1/password.html.txt`
6. Open `/test2.html` — a new row should appear under **Password** with version, description, and links.
