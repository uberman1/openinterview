# OpenInterview Password QA — Option C Runner

## What this does
- Runs unit + story tests against your **real** page: `public/password.html`
- Writes a consolidated report to: `qa/password/v0.1.2/tests.txt`
- Snapshots the source to: `qa/password/v0.1.2/password.html.txt`
- Appends a new row to **Password** in `/test2.html` (falls back to `/qa/_shadow/test2-shadow.html` if protected)

## Quick start
1) Upload and unzip into your project root.
2) Ensure you already have `test2.html` in the project root.
3) Run:
```bash
bash execute_option_c.sh
```
4) Check artifacts in `qa/password/v0.1.2/` and verify the new row in `/test2.html`.

## Notes
- This runner does **not** modify protected UI files except appending to `test2.html`. If that is also protected, it writes a shadow copy.
