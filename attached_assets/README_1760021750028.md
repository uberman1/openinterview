# Home Page Header Alignment — Minimal Fix (No Other Changes)

This tool **only** aligns the section titles and action links on the same line:
- **My Interviews** + **Create New**
- **My Resumes** + **Add New**

It wraps each pair in a single flex row (`flex items-center justify-between`) without touching anything else.

## How to use (Replit shell, at your repo root)

```bash
unzip -o home_header_fix.zip
node header-fix/apply.js
```

### What it does
- Searches for `public/home.html` (fallback: `home.html`)
- Creates a timestamped backup in the same folder
- Finds:
  - `<h2>My Interviews</h2>` and the closest `"Create New"` link after it
  - `<h2>My Resumes</h2>` and the closest `"Add New"` link after it
- Wraps each pair in:
```html
<div class="mb-4 flex items-center justify-between">
  <!-- existing <h2> -->
  <!-- existing <a> -->
</div>
```
- Leaves all other markup untouched

If the script can’t find the expected text, it **does nothing** and explains what to check.

## Rollback
Restore the backup file it created (look for `.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.html` next to your original).
