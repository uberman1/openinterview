# profile_pagev2.html — Test Deployment
Date: 2025-10-08

What this file implements:
- Sticky hero with **gentle shrink on scroll** (natural page scroll; no body overflow lock).
- Explicit **spacing** between the hero and the scroll content (small spacer div).
- Calendar that **always renders**: uses API slots if available, else falls back to sensible static times.
- Additive classing; stable ID-based selectors to avoid binder conflicts.

Usage:
- Drop `profile_pagev2.html` into your static/template path and route to it for testing.
- Pass `?handle=<handle>` to exercise `/api/public/profile/:handle` + `/api/availability?userId=...`.
