# Module 1 (Login) — Replit preview-safe

Run:
  npm install
  npm run dev   # Replit-compatible
  npm test      # guardrail + endpoint + redirect checks

Replit preview will open root `/`, which 302-redirects to `/login.html`. `public/index.html` also includes a meta-refresh and noscript fallback to ensure the login appears even if JS is blocked.
