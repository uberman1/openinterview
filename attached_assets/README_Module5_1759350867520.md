# Module 5 — File Uploads (Mock-First)

Goal: Add mock storage adapter + upload API + minimal client hook.

Included:
- server/storage.mock.ts
- server/storage.routes.ts
- client/src/components/UploadWidget.jsx
- server/routes.ts.patch
- scripts/selftest.m05.js

Apply changes, then run:
```
npm run build
MODULE_NUM=05 node scripts/selftest.js
```

Expected: upload.create, upload.meta, upload.delete all pass; oversize/invalid types rejected; logs written.
