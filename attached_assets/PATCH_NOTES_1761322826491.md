# OpenInterview × Cal.com — Replit Patch

This patch adds a Cal.com inline scheduler with a graceful fallback. No API keys required.

## Files added/updated
- `public/index.html` — updated to:
  - include `<script async src="https://cal.com/embed.js"></script>`
  - set `data-cal-link="yourteam/jane-intro"` on `#bookingCard`
  - include `<script type="module" src="/js/cal-embed.bind.js"></script>`
- `js/cal-embed.bind.js` — new binder that initializes Cal inline/popup and hides native booking on success.

> If your actual profile page lives elsewhere (e.g., `profile_v4_1_package/public/index.html`), copy the same changes there instead of `public/index.html`.

## How to deploy on Replit
1. Upload/unzip into your Repl (replace or merge into existing structure).
2. Ensure your server serves `public/` (or your current folder) as static files.
3. Set a real Cal link on the booking card:
   ```html
   <div id="bookingCard" data-cal-link="yourteam/jane-intro">
   ```
   Or expose via:
   ```html
   <script>window.__profile = { cal: { calLink: "yourteam/jane-intro" } };</script>
   ```
4. Run locally in Replit → verify the calendar renders.
5. **Deploy → Reserved VM** (or your target) and publish.

## Optional
- For popup mode: add `data-cal-mode="popup"` and a `.book-btn` inside the card.
- Keep `#bookingFallback` for .ics fallback if the embed fails.
- Later, add `/webhooks/cal` if you want to sync bookings into your DB.
