OpenInterview Binder Injector
----------------------------

This package installs a binder (runtime-injected) JavaScript file that adds the requested
"Create New" / "Add New" links above the section tables without touching protected HTML files.

Files included:
- binders/home-links.js         (the injection script)
- scripts/deploy_binder.py     (copies the script into a selected static folder in your repo)
- run.sh                       (convenience wrapper: python3 scripts/deploy_binder.py)

Usage (on Replit):
1. Upload & extract this zip into your project.
2. Run in shell: bash run.sh
   - This will copy home-links.js into a static 'binders' folder (creates public/binders if none found).
3. Add a script tag to your base template or loader (no direct edits to protected files required):
   <script src="/binders/home-links.js"></script>

The deploy script avoids editing HTML and only writes the binder JS file to your static assets.
