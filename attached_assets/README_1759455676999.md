# Module 3 Implementation Pack — Dashboard & Profile (Mock Data)

This pack adds the missing user profile editor page and guardrails to satisfy Module 3.

## Included

- `ProfileEditor.jsx` — a localStorage-backed user profile editor for the current user.
- `README.md` — guardrail prompts and human QA steps.
- `tests/module3.json` — updated to point to /#/dashboard and /#/profile.

## Guardrail Prompt — Do not move to Module 4 until:

1. Dashboard renders non-empty test content.
2. Visiting /#/profile shows a profile editor with fields for name, headline, and avatar URL.
3. Edits persist after page reload (localStorage).
4. Automated journey passes:
   MODULE=module3 npm run journey
5. Human QA (below) confirms flow works with no console errors.

## Human QA Checklist

- Visit /#/dashboard in your app. Confirm visible, non-empty content.
- Visit /#/profile. Enter your name, headline, and an avatar URL.
- Reload. Confirm values persist.
- Navigate between Dashboard and Profile. Confirm no blank screens or fatal errors.
- Check console logs for repeating errors. There should be none.
