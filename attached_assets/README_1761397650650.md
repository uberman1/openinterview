# Phase-2 Patch — Resume Auto‑Populate (Mock GPT, minimal JS)

**Goal:** Complete Section **B** (Auto-populate with Resume) without introducing backend complexity. This patch wires the resume dropdown, upload→asset registration, and a **client-side mock GPT** parser so Replit can simulate the flow deterministically.

## What this adds
- `js/profile_edit.autopop.bind.js`
  - Populates the “Select a resume” dropdown from the asset store (`type=resume`, filtered by `profileId`).
  - “Browse” uploads a resume via the existing data-store abstraction (`createAsset`), registers it, and selects it.
  - Calls a **mock GPT** parser (served as a static JSON fixture) to extract:
    - Contact: Location, Phone, Email
    - Short Bio: 1–2 sentences
    - Highlights: 5 bullets
  - Applies results into the form, sets `resumeAssetId`, and persists via the existing `updateProfile(...)` flow.
  - Emits events: `resume:auto-populate-requested` and `resume:auto-populate:applied`.
- `public/fixtures/resume_parse_fixture.json`
  - Deterministic, test-friendly output. No external API required.

## What this does *not* change (already shipped in previous patch)
- Direct HTML edits for copy, required Profile Name, availability help text, and button removals remain as-is.
- No backend endpoints are added; the mock parser fetches the fixture file locally.

## Install
Upload the ZIP and run:
```bash
bash install_phase2.sh
```
This will:
1. Copy `js/profile_edit.autopop.bind.js` to `/js/`.
2. Copy `resume_parse_fixture.json` to `/public/fixtures/` (creates the folder if missing).
3. Inject a script tag for the new binder into `profile_edit_enhanced.html` **only if it isn’t already present**.

After install, reload `profile_edit_enhanced.html?id=YOUR_PROFILE_ID` and test:
- Use the dropdown or click **Browse** to add a resume.
- The fields should auto-fill from the fixture; save to persist changes.

## Replit patch description (use in PR/commit)
**Phase‑2: Resume Auto‑Populate (Mock GPT, minimal JS)**  
- Adds a lightweight binder to wire the **Resume** dropdown + upload flow to the asset store.  
- Simulates GPT parsing via a local fixture (`/public/fixtures/resume_parse_fixture.json`).  
- Auto-fills Contact, Short Bio (1–2 sentences), and 5 Highlights; binds the same file as `resumeAssetId`.  
- Emits `resume:auto-populate:*` events for observability/tests.  
- No backend or external API calls required; keeps page load fast and logic isolated.
